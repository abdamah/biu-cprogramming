# BIU C Programming Course

C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.

It is a very popular language, despite being old.

C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

## Why Learn C?

- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
- If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming
- languages such as `Java, Python, C++, C#`, etc, as the syntax is similar
- C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python
- C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies

## Get Started With C

- To start using C, you need two things:

- A text editor, like VS Code,Notepad, to write C code, code block
- A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C code into a language that the computer will understand
- There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. You can use an **IDE** .

- But in this course we use **Vs Code** as our _IDE_
